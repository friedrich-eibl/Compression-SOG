# Bachelorthesis: Compression of 3D Gaussian Splats

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis about the Compression of 3D Gaussian splats. It was integrated into [SOG](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians) when used for testing the performance of an arithmetic codec on 3D Gaussian Splats.
